For as long as I can remember, games have been a significant part of my life. They’ve inspired me, challenged me, and provided countless hours of joy. But behind all the epic battles, sprawling worlds, and unforgettable characters, there was always one burning question: **“What would it be like to create my own game?”**

That question has driven me down a path of discovery, frustration, and triumph. Today, I want to share the story of how I’ve embraced game development—the ups, the downs, and everything in between.

## The Spark

My journey didn’t start in a college classroom or a game studio. It started with a love of technology and creativity. Growing up, I was that kid taking apart gadgets to see how they worked (and sometimes failing to put them back together). My passion for gaming was intertwined with a fascination for how games are made. As I spent countless hours playing classics like *Doom*, *Final Fantasy*, and *Crazy Taxi*, I couldn’t help but wonder: how do these incredible experiences come to life?

Years later, after serving in the U.S. Army and starting a family, I found myself with a renewed sense of purpose. I wanted to create something that could entertain and inspire others the way games had done for me. That’s when I decided to take the plunge into game development.

## Starting from Scratch

Like many indie developers, I started with no formal training. Tutorials, online courses, and a lot of trial and error became my teachers. My first projects were small and rudimentary—think bouncing balls and basic platformers. But each one taught me something valuable about coding, design, and storytelling.

It wasn’t easy. Balancing game development with work, family, and life’s responsibilities meant progress was slow. There were days when nothing seemed to work, and I questioned whether I was cut out for this. But every small victory—a bug fixed, a level completed—fueled my determination.

## Finding My Voice as a Developer

As I honed my skills, I began to understand the kind of games I wanted to make. I love games that blend engaging gameplay with a touch of humor, a sprinkle of chaos, and a whole lot of heart. This vision led to projects like *Out of Mana*, where a wizard trades his spells for guns, and *Family Man*, a retro shooter with a heartfelt story about escaping a bunker to reunite with family.

These projects taught me the importance of staying true to my creative instincts. They also showed me the power of storytelling in games—how a compelling narrative can elevate even the simplest mechanics.

## Sharing the Journey

Creating games is only part of the adventure. Documenting the process and sharing it with others has become just as rewarding. Through *It’s Just Joe Games*, I’ve been able to connect with fellow developers, gamers, and creators. From video tutorials to blog posts, sharing my journey has helped me grow as a developer while building a supportive community around my work.

## Looking Ahead

Game development is a marathon, not a sprint. There’s always more to learn, new challenges to tackle, and fresh ideas to explore. As I continue this journey, I’m excited to bring my visions to life and share them with the world.

If you’ve ever thought about making your own game, my advice is simple: start small, embrace the learning curve, and don’t be afraid to fail. Every misstep is a step forward, and every challenge is an opportunity to grow.

Thanks for joining me on this adventure. Whether you’re here as a fellow creator, a gamer, or just curious, I’m glad to have you along for the ride. Let’s see where this journey takes us!

**Stay tuned, stay creative, and game on!**
